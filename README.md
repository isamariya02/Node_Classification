# Node_Classification
Node Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (Graph Analytics)

Overview

This project applies Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to an Amazon product dataset, where nodes represent products and edges capture relationships between them. The goal is to improve node classification accuracy and uncover latent structures in the graph, enhancing product recommendations and understanding node relationships.


Key Objectives

Node Classification using GCNs.
Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE for visualization.
Graph Embedding for efficient classification and analysis.

Methods
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs): Implemented GCNs for node classification by utilizing node features and graph structures to improve prediction accuracy.
Embedding Techniques: Applied graph embedding methods to reduce the dimensionality of node features.
t-SNE Visualization: Employed t-SNE to visualize the embedded nodes and evaluate the effectiveness of GCN in capturing meaningful patterns.

Tools & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch/TensorFlow (for GCNs)
NetworkX, scikit-learn, t-SNE

Results
GCNs effectively improve node classification, with t-SNE visualizations offering insights into product relationships, supporting better recommendation systems.
